Cloud microservices [4] have become widely popular and rate limiting is usually implemented within a component called API gateway. API gateway is a fully managed service that supports rate limiting, SSL termination, authentication, IP whitelisting, servicing static content, etc. For now, we only need to know that the API gateway is a middleware that supports rate limiting. 


Algorithms for rate limiting Rate limiting can be implemented using different algorithms, and each of them has distinct pros and cons. Even though this chapter does not focus on algorithms, understanding them at high-level helps to choose the right algorithm or combination of algorithms to fit our use cases. Here is a list of popular algorithms: 

• Token bucket 
• Leaking bucket 
• Fixed window counter 
• Sliding window log 
• Sliding window counter 


High-level architecture 

The basic idea of rate limiting algorithms is simple. At the high-level, we need a counter to keep track of how many requests are sent from the same user, IP address, etc. If the counter is larger than the limit, the request is disallowed. Where shall we store counters? Using the database is not a good idea due to slowness of disk access. 

In-memory cache is chosen because it is fast and supports time-based expiration strategy.
