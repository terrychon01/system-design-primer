# I think you need to use a hash table lookup for each clientID. 
# Then each clientID will have a queue of 100 max size. 
# The queue will hold timestamps.

# Say you have a clientID with a list of 100 elements already in it. 
# Check the last added element's timestamp with the current time which will be at 
# the end of queue. If they are less than or equal to one second from each other 
# then you know you are about to add the 101th request within one second apart, so return false. Remember to pop and push even if you are returning false. Therefore, everything is O(1) run-time with O(N*100) space, N being number of clientIDs.

# An even more optimized solution is to use a pooling technique. 
# For each clientID, has a pool of 100 elements. 
# Instead of a queue, use a circular queue. 
# That way you don't waste time creating and deleting objects. 
# 
# When you add a new timestamp, just move the head pointer back one and modify. 
# When you want to check the timestamp, just check the one behind the head pointer.

# EDIT: The solution must use a timescale of milliseconds or better. 
# If you were to use seconds, it wouldn't be exact enough. 
# The seconds will be rounded up or down and you would lose precision. 
# Even a tenth of a second would not be enough. 
# If you had 100 requests at 0.1 of a second, then later you get another request at 1.1 of a second. 
# How would you know that it was exactly 1.1 or 1.099 or 1.101?? 1.101 is passed one second.
